## Metal Tube Cross-section Data
The project is a contour sequence table derived from an explicit dynamic solution in Abaqus for the full-cross-section of metal tube with 160 various geometric and machining parameters. To prevent the crucial situation of cross section deformation when creating the dataset, an appropriate sampling range for geometric and processing parameters was determined, and Latin hypercube sampling method was employed to make the sample distribution reasonable.
